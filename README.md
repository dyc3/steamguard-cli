# Usage
`steamguard-cli` looks for your `maFiles` folder in the current user's home directory (eg. `~/maFiles/`).
Your `maFiles` can be created with [Steam Desktop Authenticator][SDA]. You can create `maFiles` with
steamguard-cli using the `setup` action (`steamguard setup`).

**REMEMBER TO MAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR `maFiles`, AND TO WRITE DOWN YOUR RECOVERY CODE!**
